# amazon-lex-gcp-diaglogflow-abstraction
on simply put: ALGDA :)

In this project I try to abstract the use of amazon lex first, but then also google's dialog flow.
Why?
Becuase vendor locking is never a good idea, and because I think it can be convient to put your bot instructions in your source code and be able to version control it

How?
I am planning on using a yml with some intents and maybe also allow to referece to functions that will be used as lambda functions
